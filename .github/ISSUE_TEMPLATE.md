************************************************************************************
*READ ME FIRST*

This repository is for reporting bugs with the Docker Desktop for Mac software,
which we respond to on a best-effort basis.

Support requests in this repository (i.e., trouble installing or using the
software) will be ignored, but personalized support is available to Docker Pro and
Team customers at https://hub.docker.com/support/desktop/, and community support is
available from the Docker community Slack (https://www.docker.com/docker-community).

Issues without sufficient detail to debug them will be closed. They generally need
a clear title and description, steps to reproduce, and a diagnostics ID. See
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#diagnose-and-feedback for
how to generate a diagnostics ID either from inside the app or from the command line.
